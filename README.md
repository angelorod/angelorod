# About me 

I'm a full stack software engineer specializing in the development of single page web applications using a variety of server side and client side technologies. For the past several years I've been focusing on Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security & Spring JPA on the server side. On the client side I've been working mostly with Typescript, React.js & Material UI. I also have lots of experience with PHP, Javascript & JQuery.
